Technically, scGMAI [58] is a model for clustering but it includes an AE in the first step to combat dropout. The scGAMIâ€™s AE model is implemented with TensorFlow. 

*Model. * To impute the missing values, scGMAI applies an AE like LATE to reconstruct log-transformed expressions with dropout. One difference is that it chooses Softplus as the activation function since it is smoother than ReLU and thus more suitable for scRNA-seq data. The MSE loss as in (9) is adopted. 
After imputation, scGMAI uses fast independent component analysis (ICA) on the AE reconstructed expression to reduce the dimension and then applies a Gaussian mixture model on the ICA reduced data to perform the clustering. 

*Evaluation metrics.* It used clustering metrics including NMI, ARI, Homogeneity, and Completeness to evaluate the performance. 

*Results.* To assess the performance, the AE in scGMAI was replaced by five other imputation methods including SAVER [32], MAGIC [55], DCA [23], scImpute [33], and CIDR[59]. A scGMAI implementation without AE was also compared. Seventeen scRNA-seq data (part of them are listed in Table \@ref(tab:Table2) as marked) were used to evaluate cell clustering performances. The results indicated that the AEs significantly improved the clustering performance in eight of seventeen scRNA-Seq datasets.
