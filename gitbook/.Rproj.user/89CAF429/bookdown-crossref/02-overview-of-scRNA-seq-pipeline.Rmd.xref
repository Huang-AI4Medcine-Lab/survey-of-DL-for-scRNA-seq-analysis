h1:ch-2 Overview of scRNA-seq processing pipeline
fig:Figure1 Single cell data analysis steps for both conventional ML methods (bottom) and DL methods (top). Depending on the input data and analysis objectives, major scRNA-se analysis steps are illustrated in the center flow chart. The convential ML approaches along with optional analysis modules are presented below each analysis step. Deep learning approaches are categorized as neural network models (DNN, CNN, CapsNet, and DANN), Generalive Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Autoencoder, and Autoencoder. For each DL approach, optional algorithms are listed on top of each step in the pipeline.
