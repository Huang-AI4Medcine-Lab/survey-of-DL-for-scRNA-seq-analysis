netAE [107] is a VAE-based semi-supervised cell type prediction model that deals with scenarios of having a small number of labeled cells. 

*Model.* netAE works with UMI counts and assumes a ZINB distribution for x_gn as in Eq. (32) in scVI. However, netAE adopts the general VAE loss as in eq. (6) with two function-specific loss as 
	L(Θ)=-L(Θ)+λ_1 ∑_(n∈S)▒Q(z_n ) +λ_2 ∑_(n∈S_L)▒〖logf(y_n│z_n ) 〗	(45)
where S is a set of indices for all cells and S_Lis a subset of S for only cells with cell type labels, Q is modified Newman and Girvan modularity [108] that quantifies cluster strength using z_n, f is the softmax function, and y_n is the cell type label. The second loss in (34) functions as a clustering constraint and the last term is the cross-entropy loss that constrains the cell type classification. 

*Evaluation metrics.* Accuracy of cell type classification was used to assess the performance. 

*Results:* netAE was compared with popular dimension reduction methods including scVI, ZIFA, PCA and AE as well as a semi-supervised method scANVI [109]. For different dimension reduction methods, cell type classification from latent features of cells was carried out using KNN and logistic regression.  The effect of different labeled samples sizes on classification performance was also investigated, where the sample size varied from as few as 10 cells to 70% of all cells. Among 3 test datasets (mouse brain cortex, human embryo development, and mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells), netAE outperformed most of the baseline methods.  Latent features were visualized using t-SNE and cell clusters by netAE were tighter than those by other embedding spaces. There was also consistency of better cell-type classification with improved cell type clustering by netAE. This suggested that the latent spaces learned with added modularity constraint in the loss helped identify clusters of similar cells.  Ablation study by removing each of the three loss terms in Eq (45) showed a drop of cell-type classification accuracy, suggesting all three were necessary for the optimal performance.
