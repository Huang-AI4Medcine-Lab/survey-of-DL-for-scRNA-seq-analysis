##  Automated cell type identification {#ch-5-6}

scRNA-Seq is able to catalog cell types in complex tissues under different conditions. However, the commonly adopted manual cell typing approach based on known markers is time-consuming and less reproducible. We survey deep learning models that take the task of automated cell type identification.
