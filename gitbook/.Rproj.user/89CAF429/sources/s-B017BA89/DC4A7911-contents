Solo [93] is a semi-supervised deep learning approach that identifies doublets with greater accuracy than other existing methods.

*Model.* Solo identifies doublets by embedding cells using VAE first and then appends a feed-forward neural network layer to the encoder to form a supervised classifier on the labeled training samples. The method assumes that most cells in an experiment are singlets and one can approximate a view into the doublet population by generating simulated doublets in silico from the observed data. In Solo, doublets are assumed to have less than twice the UMI depth on average but an option to scale the merged counts by a specific factor is also provided. The method operates in three phases: (1) doublet simulation where a number N_d of doublets are generated by taking the sum of randomly chosen observed cells considered putative singlets, and then model was trained to differentiate these in silico doublets from the observed data; (2) cell embedding where Solo embeds cells in a nonlinear latent space via a VAE that follows the scVI architecture; and (3) classifier training where a standard discriminative classifier is added to the end of the scVI encoder and trained using the simulated doublet samples and the observed cells to predict doublet status. Only the added classifier layer was trained with a binary cross-entropy loss, the scVI encoder was fixed during training.

*Evaluation metrics.* The performance was measured using precision-recall (PR) and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and summarized with average precision (AP) and area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC). 

*Results.*  Solo performance was tested on a singlet/doublet population simulated using the Splatter toolkit [85] and several experimental datasets, where Solo exceeds the performance of previous non-deep learning methods like Scrublet [94] and DoubletFinder [95] by greater margins in the larger and more complex datasets. Solo also outperformed existing computational methods for this task on a variety of cell line and tissue datasets with experimental doublet annotations.
