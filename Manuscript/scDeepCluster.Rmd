scDeepCluster [@RN133]<!--[78]--> is an AE network that simultaneously learns feature representation and performs clustering via explicit modeling of cell clusters as in DESC.

*Model:*  Similar to DCA, scDeepCluster adopts a ZINB distribution for $x_{n}$ as in Eq. (\@ref(eq:eq11)) and (\@ref(eq:eq12)). The loss function is

\begin{equation}
L(\Theta)=L_{0}(\Theta)+\gamma L_{c}(\Theta) (\#eq:eq30)
\end{equation}
                                                                                            
where $L_{0}$ is the negative log-likelihood of the ZINB data distribution as defined in Eq. (\@ref(eq:eq13)) and $L_{c}$ a clustering loss performed using $KL$ divergence as Eq. (\@ref(eq:eq20)) defined in DESC algorithm.  Comparing to csvis, in terms of clustering regularization, scvis uses t-SNE objective function which is faithful to feature representation by keeping local structure, while scDeepcluster uses KL divergence based clustering which focuses more on clustering assignment.

*Evaluation metrics.* The following three metrics are used to evaluate the performance, NMI, clustering accuracy, and ARI. 

*Results.* scDeepCluster was first tested on the simulation data and compared with other seven methods including DCA [@RN53]<!--[15]-->, two multi-kernel spectral clustering methods MPSSC [@RN135]<!--[79]--> and SIMLR [@RN38]<!--[40]-->, CIDR [@RN113]<!--[59]-->, PCA + k-mean, scvis [@RN127]<!--[73]--> and DEC [@RN253]<!--[80]-->. In different dropout rate simulations, scDeepCluster significantly outperformed the other methods consistently. In signal strength, imbalanced sample size, and scalability simulations, scDeepcluster outperformed all other algorithms and scDeepCluster and most notably advantages for weak signals, robust against different data imbalance levels and scaled linearly with the number of cells. scDeepCluster was then tested on four real datasets (10X PBMC, Mouse ES cells, Mouse bladder cells, Worm neuron cells) and shown to outperform all other comparing algorithms. Particularly, MPSSC and SIMLR failed to process the full datasets due to quadratic complexity.
