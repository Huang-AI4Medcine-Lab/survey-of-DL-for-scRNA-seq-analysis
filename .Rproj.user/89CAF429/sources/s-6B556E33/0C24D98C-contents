We start our review by introducing the general formulations of widely used deep learning models. As most of the tasks including batch correction, dimensionality reduction, imputation, and clustering are unsupervised learning tasks, we will give special attention to unsupervised models including variational autoencoder (VAE), the autoencoder (AE), or generative adversarial networks (GAN). We will also discuss the general supervised and transfer learning formulations, which find their applications in cell type predictions and functional studies. We will discuss these models in the context of scRNA-seq, detailing the different features and training strategies of each model and bringing attention to their uniqueness.
