Supervised deep learning models, including deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and capsule networks (CapsNet), have been used for cell type identifications [51-53] and functional predictions [54]. The general supervised deep learning model $F$ takes $x_{n}$ as  an input and outputs $p(y_{n}|x_{n})$, the probability of phenotype label $y_n$ (e.g. a cell type) as 

\begin{equation}
	p(y_n│x_n)=F(x_n),	(\#eq:eq10v2)
\end{equation}	
	
	
where $F$ can be DNN, CNN, or CapsNet. We omit the discussion of DNN and CNN as they are widely used in different applications and there are many excellent surveys on them [55]. We will focus our discussion on CasNet next.  

A CasNet takes an expression $x_n$ to first form a feature extraction network (consisting of $L$ parallel single-layer neural networks) followed by a classification capsule network. Each of the $L$ parallel feature extraction layers generates a primary capsule $u_l∈\mathbb{R}^{d_p}$ as

\begin{equation}
	u_l=ReLU(W_{P,l},x_{n})  \forall{l}=1,…,L,	(\#eq:11v2)
\end{equation}

where $W_{P,l}∈\mathbb{R}^{d_p×G}$ is the weight matrix. Then, the primary capsules are fed into the capsule network to compute $K$ label capsules $v_k∈\mathbb{R}^{d_t}$, one for each label, as

\begin{equation}
 v_k=squash(\sum_{l}^{L}c_{kl}W_{kl}u_{l}) \space ∀k=1,…,K, (\#eq:12v2)
\end{equation}

where $squash$ is the squashing function [56] to normalize the magnitude of its input vector to be less than one, $W_{kl}$ is another trainable weight matrix, and $c_{kl} \space \forall{l}=1,…,L$, are the coupling coefficients that represent the probability distribution of each primary capsule’s impact on the predicted label $k$.  Parameters $c_{kl}$ are not trained but computed through the dynamic routing process proposed in the original capsule networks [52]. The magnitude of each capsule $v_k$ represents the probability of predicting label $k$ for input $x_n$. Once trained, the important primary capsules for each label and then the most significant genes for each important primary capsule can be used to interpret biological functions associated  with the prediction.

The training of the supervised models for classification overwhelmingly minimizes the cross-entropy loss by stochastic gradient descent computed by a back-propagation algorithm.
