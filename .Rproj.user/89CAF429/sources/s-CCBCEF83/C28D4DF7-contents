# Survey of deep learning models for scRNA-Seq analysis  {#Survey}


In this section, we survey applications of DL models for scRNA-seq analysis. To better understand the relationship between the problems that each surveyed work addresses and the key challenges in the general scRNA-seq processing pipeline,  we divide the survey into sections according to steps in the scRNA-seq processing pipeline illustrated in Fig.\@ref(fig:Figure1). For each DL model, we present the model details under the general model framework introduced in Section \@ref(dl-model-for-scRNA-seq) and discuss the specific loss functions. We also survey the evaluation metrics and summarize the evaluation results. To facilitate cross-references of the information, we summarized all algorithms reviewed in this section in Table \@ref(tab:Table1) and tabulate the datasets and evaluation metrics used in each paper in Tables \@ref(tab:Table2a) & \@ref(tab:Table3). We also listed all other algorithms that each surveyed method evaluated against in Fig.\@ref(fig:Figure3), highlighting the extensiveness these algorithms were assessed for their performance.
